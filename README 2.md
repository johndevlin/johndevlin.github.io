Boilerplate
===========


Uh?
---

This is a super lightweight front-end framework made to use with [Hammer for Mac](http://hammerformac.com/). It's based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), with some unnecessary stuff taken out, and some [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) & [Bourbon Mixins](http://bourbon.io/) added in.


To-dos
------

Some features I'll be adding in.

* Making this responsive with [Bourbon Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)
